   abstract = {The loss of vital littoral zone and riparian habitat due to lakeshore residential development is a pervasive issue across temperate aquatic ecosystems. Oligotrophic glacial lakes may be particularly vulnerable to reductions in coarse woody habitat (CWH) due to their lack of alternative structural habitat. Although influences of CWH on fish populations have been well documented, questions remain regarding CWH influences on lower trophic levels and water quality. We conducted a whole-lake CWH addition experiment within a BACI framework using 2 lakes, Sanford (treatment) and Escanaba (reference), in the Northern Highland Lake District of Wisconsin. Premanipulation monitoring began in 2015, trees were dropped in 2018, and data collection continued until 2023. We monitored limnological, planktonic, and benthic macroinvertebrate parameters to test whether CWH addition initiated trophic shifts and altered the structure of the aquatic food web. We found that CWH addition minimally affected water quality and changed some characteristics of Sanford Lake at lower trophic levels. Chlorophyll a concentrations in Sanford Lake significantly increased but Secchi depth was unaffected. The abundance of macrophytes increased in both systems; that in Sanford Lake increased more and was linked to the CWH addition. Dissolved oxygen significantly increased at multiple depth strata. Water temperature was unaffected. We observed declines in total zooplankton that were not related to CWH addition, but the decline in relative abundance of large grazers was. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of the effects of habitat enhancement at an ecosystem scale and can help guide stakeholder and manager expectations following CWH addition.},

   abstract = {Individual and environmental factors may influence gamete characteristics and contributions to recruitment in fishes. We tested for the influence of maternal, abiotic, and biotic factors on egg diameter and quality (i.e., oil droplet diameter) for walleye Sander vitreus in Escanaba Lake, Wisconsin, during 2018–2023 (omitting 2020). Analyses were conducted on fish captured once and for the same individuals captured multiple times during our study period. In the single-capture analysis, increasing maternal length was weakly related to larger egg diameter and oil droplet size. Increased yellow perch abundance was somewhat related to increased intra-clutch variation, whereas a later ice-off date was related to reduced intra-clutch variation. Fish that spawned later had more variable egg and oil droplet diameters. Among fish that were sampled over multiple years, individual identity was a strong predictor of egg and oil diameter. Our results suggest that regulations that preserve among individual variation in egg traits could increase the chances that environmental conditions will be favorable for spawning and recruitment for at least some fish.},

   abstract = {Fish egg studies provide insights into reproductive health, hatchery success, and population dynamics. Metrics for assessing egg quality, such as diameter, weight, and energetic content, are challenging to accurately measure because eggs degrade rapidly, and eggs are often preserved with formalin. Research is limited and has shown mixed results regarding effects of formalin preservation on egg diameter. No data exist on the influence of formalin preservation on oil droplet diameter. Egg and oil droplet diameters can be indicators of egg nutritional condition and subsequent larval survival and dynamics. We analyzed the diameter of Walleye Sander vitreus egg and oil droplets before and after formalin preservation from one Wisconsin and five Minnesota waterbodies in 2023. Preservation in 10% formalin altered egg and oil droplet diameters. The preservation effect differed depending on the initial egg or oil droplet diameter. Larger and smaller eggs decreased and increased in diameter following storage in formalin, respectively. Preserved eggs were more challenging to measure than fresh eggs due to changes in morphology, burst oil droplets, and increased opacity. Even though the preservation effects were small (5–12%), we recommend that studies involving precise egg measurements avoid formalin storage. The error introduced by formalin preservation was sufficient to prevent detection of small changes, particularly in the oil droplet.},

I am currently working for the Wisconsin DNR as a Fisheries Research Scientist conducting research to fulfill management goals for the state. I am most interested in improving our mechanistic understanding of how population dynamics and anthropogenic factors affect the trajectory of fish communities over time.

I would describe myself as a generalist jack-of-all trades scientist. I am interested in many different topics orbiting within the field of "fisheries ecology". I just enjoy digging into different applied problems, and continually challenging myself with learning new things. 
        
*"Struggle builds strength" - the challenge of learning new things keeps us humble and resilient.*

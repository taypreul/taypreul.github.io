I currently work for the Wisconsin DNR Office of Applied Science as a Fisheries Research Scientist. We work in tandem with the WIDNR Bureau of Fisheries Management, federal, and tribal partners to investigate fisheries concerns across the state. I am most interested in improving our mechanistic understanding of external and anthropogenic factors affect the trajectory of fish communities over time. I have worked on topics such as Walleye recruitment and egg quality, coarse woody habitat additions, and collaborative technical projects. I am currently working on a myriad of different topics, all related to alleviating threats to fish communities (and the human communities that rely on them).

I would describe myself as a generalist jack-of-all trades scientist. I am interested in many different topics orbiting within the field of "fisheries ecology". I just enjoy digging into different applied problems, and continually challenging myself with learning new things. 
        
*"Struggle builds strength" - the challenge of learning new things keeps us humble and resilient.*

======

I am currently working for the Wisconsin DNR as a Fisheries Research Scientist conducting research to fulfill management goals for the state. I am most interested in improving our mechanistic understanding of how population dynamics and anthropogenic factors affect the trajectory of fish communities over time.

======
I would describe myself as a generalist jack-of-all trades scientist. I am interested in many different topics orbiting within the field of "fisheries ecology". I just enjoy digging into different applied problems, and continually challenging myself with learning new things. 
        
*"Struggle builds strength" - the challenge of learning new things keeps us humble and resilient.*

We live in a diverse world facing a multitude of stressors. "Death by a thousand cuts" is a common paradigm, but it can be difficult to resolve managment concerns when we are lacking a whole-ecosystem perspective of mechanistic drivers of fish declines. Expanding the toolset available to managers to include habitat and forage angles can inform why traditional rehab metrics may be less successful.
       
The historical management of natural and cultural resources has not typically involved true integration of tribal and non-tribal partners in the decision making process. Compartmentalization is common, which can lead to inefficiencies and mistrust in a system which desperately requires collaboration and reciprocal relationships. Regardless of the research or management topic, it is vital to prioritize reciprocity and acknowledgment of historical inequities among tribal nations and the organisms themselves.</p>

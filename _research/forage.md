    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Forage and Non-game Species</h2>
    <p>The consideration of forage/non-game species and habitat is often neglected in fisheries management due to budget & time constraints. However, an understanding of ecosystem limitations is key to resolving potential fishery declines. Our current top-down (gamefish focused) paradigm is good for keeping tabs on popular sportfish but is limited in understanding mechanistic reasons for observed declines. We are currently studying the factors influencing Yellow Perch year class strength using the long term NHFRA dataset. We are also conducting novel surveys to investigate capture efficiency for forage fish and evaluate availability for Walleye through ontogeny.</p>

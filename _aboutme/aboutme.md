I am an aquatic critter originally from western Iowa. I grew up exploring the limitless swamps, forests, and lakes of the Northwoods of Wisconsin. I spent my junior year of high school on foreign exchange to Finland. I attended Nicolet Area Technical College for two years before transferring to Northern Michigan University to complete my BS Biology-Ecology in 2017. I received my MS Fisheries Management from Montana State University in 2022. Regardless of where I am, there is always something beautiful in nature or in people. From the smallest salamander to the biggest redwoods, there are many wonders to appreciate. Travel provides the best opportunites to stay humble and open minded

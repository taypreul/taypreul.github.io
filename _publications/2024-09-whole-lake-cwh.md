The loss of vital littoral zone and riparian habitat due to lakeshore residential development is a pervasive issue across temperate aquatic ecosystems. Oligotrophic glacial lakes may be particularly vulnerable to reductions in coarse woody habitat (CWH) due to their lack of alternative structural habitat. Although influences of CWH on fish populations have been well documented, questions remain regarding CWH influences on lower trophic levels and water quality. We conducted a whole-lake CWH addition experiment within a BACI framework using 2 lakes, Sanford (treatment) and Escanaba (reference), in the Northern Highland Lake District of Wisconsin. Premanipulation monitoring began in 2015, trees were dropped in 2018, and data collection continued until 2023. We monitored limnological, planktonic, and benthic macroinvertebrate parameters to test whether CWH addition initiated trophic shifts and altered the structure of the aquatic food web. We found that CWH addition minimally affected water quality and changed some characteristics of Sanford Lake at lower trophic levels. Chlorophyll a concentrations in Sanford Lake significantly increased but Secchi depth was unaffected. The abundance of macrophytes increased in both systems; that in Sanford Lake increased more and was linked to the CWH addition. Dissolved oxygen significantly increased at multiple depth strata. Water temperature was unaffected. We observed declines in total zooplankton that were not related to CWH addition, but the decline in relative abundance of large grazers was. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of the effects of habitat enhancement at an ecosystem scale and can help guide stakeholder and manager expectations following CWH addition.
